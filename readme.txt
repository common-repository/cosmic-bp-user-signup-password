Cosmic BP User Signup Password plugin allows buddypress site owners to let new user choose their own password at the time of registration.

== Description ==

 Cosmic BP User Signup Password allows buddypress site owners the flexibility to let their user choose their won password at the time of registraton.If the user does not fills a password of his own choice,a random generated password is sent to the user on activation .
This plugin simply inserts a password field in buddypress signup/registration form.So,once you have enabled it, new users on your site can choose their own password at the time of registration.I made this plugin,as currently, no alternative exists for allowing user to set their own password at the time of registration in buddypress.
